                    <hr>
                    <p>Three months after writing my first hello world program(while working in the marketing department).I had convinced my boss to let me take a stab at building a better version of the outdated laboratory management system my company was running on.</p>
                    <p>Before i knew it we transitioned from the old system and we are on to mine. My newbie self was now in change of hosting hundereds of thousands of lab samples and supporting thousands of clients</p>
                    <p>From this you'll see that I am someone that jumps before i can talk myself out of doing something scary. </p>

                        I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation is just a reference.
